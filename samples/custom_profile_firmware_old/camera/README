Before running the host side Linux application Custom profile has to be created using bluegiga profile creation tools,
Refer to the following link about custom profile creation tools

The steps which need to be followed are explained followed in our use case are explained below.
These steps need to be followed windows PC.

1.Download the Bluegiga BluetoothÂ® Smart Software Stack.

2.You will download a Bluegiga-ble-[versions].exe. Double click on the executable and follow the steps
	prompted by the application to complete the installation.

3.If you have given default settings while installing, SDK will be installed to C:\Bluegiga directory.

4.If this is the first time you are using BLED112 in your windows, Then you need to install the drivers.
	Drivers are provided by Bluegiga and reside in C:\Bluegiga\ble-[version]\windrv. This folder contains two
	drivers, one required for communicating with BLED112 in normal mode. One more is required for updating the
	firmware in the bootloader mode. Install these drivers by manually selecting the drivers directory When
	windows automatically tries to install the drivers.

5.Once you are successfully installed you can see Bluegiga dongle connected to one of the COM port of windows.

6.If you want to understand and play around with BLED112 dongle run blegui2.exe application present in the bin
	folder. Otherwise go to next step.

7.Once you followed the above steps you are ready to build a custom profile application for BLED112.

8.Now download the custom profile application project from https://gitlab.motius.de.
	Go to following link to download the project https://gitlab.motius.de/internal/b-and-r-middelware/tree/developer .
	Download as zip file and extract it.

9.In the extracted folder you will see a drectory custom_profile_firmware\camera go to this directory.
	This directory contains a custom profile project.

10.For building the project, Open command prompt in windows. Go to C:\Bluegiga\ble-[SDK version]\bin\
	This folder contains a windows executable by name bgbuild.exe this is the compiler which builds the project.
	Execute the following command to build the project.
	Example: bgbuild.exe <path_to_custom_profile_project>\project-ble112.bgproj Above command will create a binary
	out-ble112.hex This file contains the firmware which need to flashed to the dongle.

11.Launch the BLE GUI application, select the BLED112 port and try to connect by clicking the "Attach" button.
	If all goes well, you will see green "Connected" message. Then select Commands/DFU menu item,
	select the HEX file we have just generated, click on the "Boot into DFU mode" button. One peculiarity of
	the BLED112 that in DFU mode it becomes logically another USB device so the main window will display red
	"Disconnected" message(If windows fa  Then click "Upload".
	If the upload counter reaches 100% and you see the "Finished" message, the firmware update is done.
	Once the above steps are done. Dongle is ready for running Linux side application,
	Disconnect the dongle and connect it to board/PC.
